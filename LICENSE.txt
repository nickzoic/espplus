Right now, the 'test' code uses V-USB, which is GPLv2, so that version of the code will
have to be under GPLv2 as well I suppose.

However, the project may end up changing over to LUFA, which is MIT licensed, in which
case the whole thing will be released under MIT license.

In the meantime, you should regard this code as 'not yet released'.
