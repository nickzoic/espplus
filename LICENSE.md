# LICENSE.md

See LICENSE.md files in the subdirectories for the licenses for the code under those
subdirectories.

* Right now, the 'test' code uses V-USB, which is GPLv2, so the code in that directory
will have to be under GPLv2 as well.

* However, the project may end up changing over to LUFA, which is MIT licensed, in which
case that part will be released under MIT license as well.

* The docs directory contains the web IDE, which is MIT licensed.
