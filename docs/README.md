# espplus

An attempt to make a friendlier out-of-box experience for MicroPython / ESP32 ...
see http://nick.zoic.org/art/micropython-webusb/

This is the Web IDE, hosted at https://nickzoic.github.io/espplus/

If you want to run it locally, you'll need to set up a self-signed certificate and a 
little HTTPS server ... Chrome won't let you use these APIs from `http://` or `file://` pages.
